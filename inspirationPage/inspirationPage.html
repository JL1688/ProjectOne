                    Zhu Tiexiong's work uses amazing special effects and story lines
                    to promote traditional culture. The expression of emotion and
                    the spread of positive energy in his work inspired me to explore.

                    Niu Yifei's works are skillfully created with natural materials
                    (leaves, stones, etc.). His works are a close link between nature
                    and art. His way of creating has given me a new sense of imagination
                    for design.

                    Lix Xiaolingtong is famous for his role as the Wukong (Monkey King).
                    The internet says it took him 17 years to complete the character of
                    Sun Wukong. This may be the reason why among all the versions of
                    Journey to the West, only his performance of the Monkey King will
                    become a classic character in the minds of a generation. His
                    dedication and persistence to his art made me realize that good
                    creations require in-depth knowledge and time investment.
