        <p>
            Zhu Tiexiong's work uses amazing special effects and story lines<br>
            to promote traditional culture. The expression of emotion and<br>
            the spread of positive energy in his work inspired me to explore.

        <p>
            Niu Yifei's works are skillfully created with natural materials<br>
            (leaves, stones, etc.). His works are a close link between nature<br>
            and art. His way of creating has given me a new sense of imagination<br>
            for design.

        <p>
            Lix Xiaolingtong is famous for his role as the Wukong (Monkey King).<br>
            The internet says it took him 17 years to complete the character of<br>
            Sun Wukong. This may be the reason why among all the versions of<br>
            Journey to the West, only his performance of the Monkey King will<br>
            become a classic character in the minds of a generation. His<br>
            dedication and persistence to his art made me realize that good<br>
            creations require in-depth knowledge and time investment.
