            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>He is from the East of Asia, China, and is an Asian with
                Chinese ancestry. His first and most common language is Chinese,
                and English is his second language, making him bilingual.
            </p>

            <p>
                He currently lives in Oakland, about 18 kilometers away from San
                Francisco. His hobbies include reading comic books, watching
                videos online, and playing video games. Although these activities
                are primarily centered around the virtual world, he sees them as
                a relatively low-cost form of entertainment. What really attracts
                him to these forms of entertainment are the elements of design
                and creativity, such as the activities and rewards that the
                games officially offer during the holidays, which demonstrate
                extremely creative visual representations.
            </p>

            <p>
                As his family membershave their own jobs, being a full-time student
                he is usually responsible for the cooking tasks at home. This has enabled
                him to develop some cooking skills such as deep-frying, boiling,
                steaming, pan-frying and stir-frying. In his opinion, nature is
                the greatest artist of all, and the green forests and the blue sea
                are immensely fascinating.
