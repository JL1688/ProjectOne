            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>He is from the East of Asia, China, and is an Asian with
                Chinese ancestry. His first and most common language is Chinese,
                and English is his second language, making him bilingual.
            </p>

            <p>
                He currently lives in Oakland, about 18 kilometers away from San
                Francisco. His hobbies include reading comic books, watching
                videos online, and playing video games. Although these activities
                are primarily centered around the virtual world, he sees them as
                a relatively low-cost form of entertainment. What really attracts
                him to these forms of entertainment are the elements of design
                and creativity, such as the activities and rewards that the
                games officially offer during the holidays, which demonstrate
                extremely creative visual representations.
            </p>

            <p>
                As his family membershave their own jobs, being a full-time student
                he is usually responsible for the cooking tasks at home. This has enabled
                him to develop some cooking skills such as deep-frying, boiling,
                steaming, pan-frying and stir-frying. In his opinion, nature is
                the greatest artist of all, and the green forests and the blue sea
                are immensely fascinating.

        <p>I am a student at San Francisco State University and I am in my 4th
            year of college. My major is computer science, and the programming
            languages I have been exposed to/briefly know are Java, HTML, css,
            JavaScript, c++, python. The programming language I am most familiar
            with is Java. I am from the east of Asia, China. I am Asian and all
            my ancestors are Chinese. My first language is Chinese, which is
            my usual language. English is my second language, so I am a
            bilingual. I currently live in Oakland, which is about 18 kilometers
            away from San Francisco. My hobbies are reading comic books, watching
            videos online, and playing video games. Although they all tend to be
            virtual worlds, I consider them as a relatively low-cost form of
            entertainment. However what really attracts me to them is their design,
            creativity, and so on. This includes the activities and rewards that
            the game officially puts in place based on holidays, with very
            creative visual presentations designed in both. My family has jobs
            and I am a full time student, so cooking duties are usually my
            responsibility. This gives me some cooking skills like deep frying,
            boiling, steaming, sauteing and stir frying. I think nature is
            the best artist, the green forests and the blue sea are fascinating.</p>-->
