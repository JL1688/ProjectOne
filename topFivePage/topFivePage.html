                <p>These dogs are in my top 5 favorites because they all have fluffy coats,
                    sparkling eyes, fun personalities and are very cute and energetic. Secondly
                    they are gentle, loyal and offer us both companionship and comfort.</p>

            <p>These foods are in my top 5 favorites because of their great taste and
                variety of flavors. In the case of ice cream, it comes in many flavors
                such as vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, mint and on and on.</p>
